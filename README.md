## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on exploring the USA Housing dataset and leveraging linear regression modeling to predict housing prices. Through various phases, including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data visualization, model training, and evaluation, we aim to provide insights into the dataset and develop an accurate predictive model.

## 2. Data Overview

The USA Housing dataset contains information about housing features such as average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, and more. It serves as the foundation for our exploration and modeling efforts.

## 3. Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
# Set up your virtual environment (optional but recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Usage

Explore each phase of the project by navigating through the folders and Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks are sequentially ordered to guide you through preprocessing, EDA, data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
